As you can see, this is only a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player:

- The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

To run the game, use: `python adventure_game.py`
